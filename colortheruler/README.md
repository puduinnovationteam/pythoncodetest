Fill the rulers with colors : 
We have wooden ruler of size 15cm,30cm and 45cm. When a user executes the code, he/she should be randomly given one ruler. He/She is also given with three color sketches. Using those colors they need to create color boxes and completely fill the ruler. But there is a condition, using red color you can paint only 1 cm length box, using blue only 3 cm, using green 5 cm. All colors should be used and you can have one or more boxes of same color. So that user should mention how many red, blue, green box he will paint and we need to check whether those boxes cover the complete ruler.

For examples: 
one user executes and we give him a 15 cm ruler. User fills with 1 red boxes, 3 blue boxes  and 1 green box. Then we should return with correct message.
Another user is given a 30 cm ruler. He fills with 5 red boxes, 4 blue boxes,2 green boxes. Here still 3 cm box is not filled. So we should return with wrong message.
